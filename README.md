# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science portfolio! This is a running repository that includes my notable projects. This project reflect my skills in data analysis, machine learning, as well as detailing my decision processes.

## Deep Neural Network Framework

This project applies a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to predict how much a customer **spend_per_item** based on their shopping behavior, using a fictional retail dataset. The project showcases end-to-end modeling in R with `tidymodels` and `keras`, including data preprocessing, custom modeling design, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.

## Explanatory Analysis

This project explores how customer characteristics and situational factors predict **tip_percentage** at restaurants. Using linear models with regularization (`glmnet`), I evaluated how different modeling decisions affect predictive performance and explanatory insight.

## Survey Report

In this project, I created a Qualtrics survey about nutritional knowledge and consumer behavior. I collected participants from Prolific and analyzed the data using Python. I created a data dictionary and generated some basic descriptive statistics. As well as conducted a $Chi^2$ analysis.
