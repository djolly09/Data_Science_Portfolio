# Deep Neural Network Framework

This project applies a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to predict how much a customer **spend_per_item** based on their shopping behavior, using a fictional retail dataset. The project showcases end-to-end modeling in R with `tidymodels` and `keras`, including data preprocessing, custom modeling design, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.
